# sort-lists
Splits a list of integers into a list of lower and higher integers than a user-given number

Takes a list of integers, for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and prints out a list with all the integers of the list
that are less than a number given by the user
and another list with the remaining integers.

If an incorrect number is given,
user has a second chance to enter the number.
